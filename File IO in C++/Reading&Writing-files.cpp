/*
The useful classes for working with files in C++ are:
1. fstreambase
2. ifstream --> derived from fstreambase
3. ofstream --> derived from fstreambase

In order to work with files in C++, you will have to open it. There are 2 ways to open a file:
1. Using a constructor
2. Using the member function open() of the class
